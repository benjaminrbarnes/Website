Website
=======

A personal, static website hosted on S3

[How to use Yeoman](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular) since I always forget

# To create a new route:
`yo angular:route <ROUTE_NAME>`

# To get started
* `npm install`
* `bower install`
* `grunt serve`

# To update site
* `grunt build`
* Upload `dist` dir to S3
* Repeat in a few months when you have something to add

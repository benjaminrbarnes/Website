Website
=======

A personal, static website hosted on S3. A few of the photos are in the repo but most
live on Flickr.

[How to use Yeoman](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular) since I always forget

# Create a new route
`yo angular:route <ROUTE_NAME>`

# Get started
* `npm install`
* `bower install`
* `grunt serve`

# Updating site
* `grunt build`
* Upload `dist` dir to S3
* Repeat in a few months when you have something to add
